# Filters-Frequency-Analysis

The semester project of the course "Signals &amp; Systems" of NTUA - 2020.

## Description

In this project we design some filters (Echo, Reverb, Bandpass), and try them on audio files. Also we isolate harmonics of music notes.<br>
The code is in file `program.m` (in Matlab).

## Files

The original project description is in file `SignalsSystemsCourseProject.pdf`, and the final report is in file `report.pdf` (both in greek). The `SignalsSystemsCourseProject2021_AdditionalFiles.rar` archive contains the original audio files used in the project, and the `echoed.wav` and `reverbed.wav` are the products of our work.
